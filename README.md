# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Aussie living in Atlanta, GA with my family and two dogs, an English Mastiff and a chocolate lab. I moved to Atlanta from Melbourne, Australia in 2019 and I'm living my best life here. I love all kinds of sports but I have a special affinity for baseball (Go Braves!). I enjoy eating great food, hanging with family and friends, and traveling. 

I'm a Senior QA Engineer who's all about making web applications high quality and bug-free. I am experienced in manual testing and automated testing, using different programming languages and tools in my toolbox. My journey is all about delivering a high quality digital experience for users to enjoy.
