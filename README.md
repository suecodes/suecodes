# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![me](https://github.com/suecodes/suecodes/blob/master/suecodes-small.png)

I am an Aussie living in Atlanta, GA with my beautiful family and two dogs, Captain Crunch (English Mastiff) and Coco Pop (Labrador Retreiver). You can follow my sweet dogs on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thecerealdogs/). I love bacon, spending time outside in the summer (preferably by the beach), running to keep fit and being with my family. 

I started my career in Melbourne, Australia as a software developer for 10 years building web applications and API web services in .NET, VB and C# with a bit of JavaScript thrown in and SQL Server. Nine years ago I transitioned to a Business Analyst role where I established good working relationships with different business stakeholders to understand their problems and needs, and identified solutions to meet their business requirements. I moved to Atlanta in March 2019 and obtained a Technical BA/QA Analyst role for a small start up leading their QA process, performing functional and regression testing. Then in 2020 I moved to another startup, specializing in healthcare data, as a Senior QA Analyst and working on a mulitude of products ensuring software quality. I don't just look for bugs. I work closely with product owners to understand requirements, offer suggestions to improve the user experience and developers to ensure the quality of the product remains high. 

I love to code and I like to keep in touch with technology by building projects to learn new languages and tools.
