# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![me](https://github.com/suecodes/suecodes/blob/master/suecodes.png)

I am an Aussie living in Atlanta, GA with my beautiful family and two dogs, Captain Crunch (English Mastiff) and Coco Pop (Labrador Retreiver). You can follow my sweet dogs on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thecerealdogs/). I love bacon, spending time outside in the summer (preferably by the beach), running to keep fit and being with my family. 

I started my career as a software developer for 10 years building web applications and API web services. Then I transitioned to a Business Analyst role where I worked with different stakeholders to understand their problems and needs, and identified solutions to support their business requirements. In Atlanta, I worked for a small start up where I set up and led their QA process, performing functional and regression testing and bug fixes. 

I love to code and I like to keep in touch with technology by building projects to learn new languages and tools. Currently, I'm enjoying Python and Django, Pytest and Selenium.
