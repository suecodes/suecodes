# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Aussie living in Atlanta, GA with my family and two dogs, an English mastiff and a chocolate lab. I moved to Atlanta from Melbourne, Australia in 2019 and I'm living my best life here. I love all kinds of sports but I have a special love for baseball (Go Braves!). I enjoy eating yummy food, being with family and friends, and traveling. 

I'm a Senior QA Engineer who's all about making web applications high quality and bug-free. I am experienced in manual testing and automated testing, using different programming languages and tools in my toolbox. I'm good at what I do, ensuring a high quality digital experience for users to enjoy.
